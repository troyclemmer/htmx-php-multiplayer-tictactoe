## introduction

This is just a proof of concept game I made in a few days.  I wanted to try making a turn-based multiplayer game using `HTMX` and `PHP`.  

### concepts
- Multiplayer (multi screen) 2 player game
- Lobby joining system
- JSON for server data
- Spectating full games support
- Viewing results of past games support
- Automatic purging of old game data (24 hours) 

## development
- Can run locally using `php -S localhost:82` on the `/public' folder
